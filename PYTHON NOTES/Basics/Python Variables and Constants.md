# Variables and Constants

In python we don't need to specify datatype like other programming languages. Python automatically assign variable a datatype by looking at the value inside that variable.

therefore syntax of variable declaration is ```< variablename> = < value>```

example


```
a = 2 

b = 12345678

c = 3.14

d = 'A'

e = 'Aaron Vincent'

```

a and b is assigned with an integer value. c is assigned with floating point, d with char and e with string

We can even assign boolean values or assign none as value to variable

```
f = True

g = None

```
